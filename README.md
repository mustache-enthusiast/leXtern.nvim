A simple tool to create, edit and save SVG files in LaTeX documents using Inkscape.

Requires Inkscape and Vimtex.

Use :LexternPreamble to add the necessary bits to your file preamble.

Use :LexternCreate to add new images, :LexternEdit to edit existing images, and :LexternAdd to easily add existing images to your LaTeX file.

:LexternCreate will drop the figure code at your cursor, while :LexternEdit and :LexternAdd place it in neovim's " register so you can place it.

A tribute to Gilles Castel, whose articles and plugins inspired many.
